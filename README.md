## Learning Journey: Object-Oriented Programming with Java

### Introduction to OOP
- Prepared the working environment for a semester of learning.
- Gained an understanding of basic OOP concepts through games like AlienBreed.
- Became familiar with class diagrams and data encapsulation principles.

### Class Creation and Management
- Created custom classes, constructors, and methods.
- Mastered method overloading and member variable representation of object state.
- Learned to control member visibility and instantiate objects from classes.

### Advanced Object-Oriented Concepts
- Utilized the 'this' keyword in various contexts.
- Crafted parametric constructors and understood object references as method parameters.
- Practiced inheritance and understood method overriding and polymorphism.
- Became adept with the 'super' keyword and method references.

### Interface Implementation and Code Refactoring
- Delved into interfaces and implemented them in coding projects.
- Deepened understanding of polymorphism and its implications.
- Practiced code refactoring for improved performance and readability.

### Static Methods, Enums, and Observer Pattern
- Used static 'main()' method for launching applications.
- Created and used custom enumeration types.
- Familiarized with the Observer design pattern.

### Advanced OOP and Design Patterns
- Practiced with marker interfaces and generic programming.
- Used Iterator design pattern and managed exceptions effectively.
- Explored game map creation using the Tiled editor and utilized the Abstract Factory pattern.
- Practiced with Observer design pattern and understood runtime class representation.

### Functional Interfaces and Decorator Pattern
- Implemented and utilized functional interfaces.
- Applied the principle of composition over inheritance.
- Used the Decorator pattern for dynamic behavior composition.
